Hack Summit 2016 Hackathon project

This is my first attempt at building a Node/Express app.

So far, this is mostly the Library App from the Pluralsight course "Building Web Applications with Node.js and Express 4.0"

https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/nodejs-express-web-applications

I'll probably use this as the basis for a new webapp after finishing the Pluralsight course.
